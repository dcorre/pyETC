#-------- FILTER -----------------------------#
#Detailed modelisation of the telescope and instrument
#If detailed is 1 then the number of mirrors, lenses, dichroics must be defined as well as
# the camera efficiency, the filer curves

#If detailed == 0: will load a throughput curve

#-------- optical design ------------------------#
# Set up the optical element in the telescope and each intrument channel.
# Note that the keywords used for defining the instrument channels are free to chose (here: DDRAGO-B, DDRAGO-R and CAGIRE). However they must be reused for the cameras properties below.
# 'telescope' contains all optical elements common for all channels
# For each type of element (i.e 'mirrors', 'lenses'...) must correspond  a folder in pyETC/transmissions/
# These folders contain files in which the transmission are given. For instance here we have one lense N-BaK4 and the file must be  pyETC/transmissions/lenses/N-BaK4.txt
# You can add your own files and folders.
